At <b>GrokSwap</b>, we are driven by three guiding principles:
<ol style="padding-top: 1em;">
<li><b>Knowledge is social.</b> It is collectively owned by everyone, and only together can we make significant progress. Cross pollination of ideas from different areas and perspectives is particularly important.</li>
<li><b>What you understand and what inspires you is valuable to others.</b> Other people may have talked about a subject before, you may not be a renowned expert on a topic, but your interpretations and the context you bring could be the thing that connects for someone else.</li>
<li><b>Concise is not the same as dumbing down.</b> The time constraints we put in place are important. We want you to get ideas and concepts quickly, and we want the process to be easy for the contributors. What we don’t want is simplification to a point where there is no longer value. Every grok must either link back to a source - a book, an article, a conference talk, a podcast - where you can go and learn more, or is based on direct experience.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="disinformation">Avoiding disinformation</h4>
<p>We want to make knowledge sharing simple, without being drowned in disinformation or inappropriate content. That is why we implement a peer review process.</p>
<p>How Grok submission works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Upload or record a Grok, either in video or audio format. Grok's are a maximum of 5 minutes in length.</li>
<li>Your submission is sent for peer review, to verify clarity and appropriateness of the content. The review is not to limit ideas, but ensure adherence to our terms of service.</li>
<li>Following review, your Grok is either published or returned to you with feedback.</li>
</ol>
There are so many important topics in the world. Collectively, we can make a difference.
