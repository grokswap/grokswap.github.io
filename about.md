<h3>You are what you grok.</h3>

At <b>GrokSwap</b>, we are driven by three guiding principles:
<ol style="padding-top: 1em;">
<li><b>Knowledge is social.</b> It is collectively owned by everyone, and only together can we make significant progress. Cross pollination of ideas from different areas and perspectives is particularly important.</li>
<li><b>What you understand and what inspires you is valuable to others.</b> Other people may have talked about a subject before, you may not be a renowned expert on a topic, but your interpretations and the context you bring could be the thing that connects for someone else.</li>
<li><b>Concise is not the same as dumbing down.</b> The time constraints we put in place are important. We want you to get ideas and concepts quickly, and we want the process to be easy for the contributors. What we don’t want is simplification to a put that there is no longer value. Every grok should link back to a source - a book, an article, a conference talk, a podcast - where you can go and learn more.</li>
</ol>
There are so many important issues in the world. Collectively, we can make a difference.
