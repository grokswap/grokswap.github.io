        <p style="padding-top: 1em;">We wanted a social medial platform that was not unsocial. A place where actual knowledge was shared; where collectively we could learn and grow.</p>
        <p>We wanted a place where brevity doesn’t mean dumbing down, but where ideas can connect and inspiration be made.</p>
        <p>We wanted the flexibility to contribute and consume in the formats that make sense for us.</p>
        <p>That's why we put Grok and Swap together.</p>
        <p><strong>That is GrokSwap.</strong></p>
