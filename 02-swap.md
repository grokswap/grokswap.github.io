<p>
    Knowledge is social, so share what you grokked! Be concise,
    but don't dumb down. Upload a short video or audio clip 
    that explains what you grokked and points people in the 
    direction where they can learn more.
</p>
<p>
    Before going live your
    grok will be peer reviewed. This is a place for swapping
    knowledge, not disinformation.
